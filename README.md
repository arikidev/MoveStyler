This is a repository for a BepInEx plugin to load custom movestyles for the game *Bomb Rush Cyberfunk* 

This is retooling of Giygas's CrewBoom and there are still numerous references to Crewboom code. Shoutout to Giygas for their work.

## Usage

Use the keys 'G,H' to navigate through default and custom movestyles

## Downloads, instructions and help

### [Plugin](https://github.com/arikidev/MoveStyler/releases)
### [Unity project](https://github.com/arikidev/MoveStyler/releases/download/WIP-0.1-Proj/moveStylerProj.zip)
### [Example Movestyle](https://github.com/arikidev/MoveStyler/releases/download/WIP_0.1_Example/MoveStyler_Ring.zip)

To create a movestyle mod you will need both of these. If you just want to use a character you downloaded, you only need the plugin. 
The project works similar to Crew Boom so you can look at the instructions there for help.

## How to:
1. Copy or create your own animator. BRC uses specific naming of the states in the animator to call animations. Refer to the example in the proj for reference. (I recomend copying one of the templates)
2. Import any new assets. Meshes and animations.
3. Change any animations that you want in your new animator

### Create a prefab
1. Add an empty transform
2. Add a animator component and assign your new animator
3. Add one or more mesh render components. remove any collision
4. Save the prefab
5. Right Click the prefab and use MoveStyler/Create Custom Movestyle.
6. Adjust the settings in your new custom Movestyle asset
7. Click -> Build Custom MoveStyle.

## Installation

This plugin requires [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/), a plugin framework for Unity games.
The easiest way to get BepInEx going for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is to use the [r2modman mod manager](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/).  

*r2modman was used to test this plugin, so other solutions may not work*

### Using r2modman

To install BepInEx, follow these steps:  
1. Open r2modman and select *Bomb Rush Cyberfunk* as the game and choose any profile
2. Navigate to the *Online* tab
3. Find *BepInEx Pack* by BepInEx and install it

## Adding movestyles

1. Navigate to your BepInEx installation for the game and open the `BepInEx/config/MoveStyler/` folder
2. Copy your character files (.cbb and .json) into the `MoveStyler` folder


## Building the plugin

This pertains to if you want to build the plugin yourself, not the Unity project.  

You will need to copy Bomb Rush Cyberfunk's `Assembly-CSharp.dll` into the `Libraries` folder of the project, as it is not provided.  
It can be found at `<path to where your games are stored>\BombRushCyberfunk\Bomb Rush Cyberfunk_Data\Managed`
